      text: "The dombyra (домбыра) is a lute-style instrument. It is an ancient and quintessential piece of Kazakh culture and identity. In its most popular form, the dombyra has two-strings strung down a long, skinny neck and a pear-shaped body, flat at the front and rounded on the backside, In the post-Soviet period, Kazakhs have looked to the past to promote national symbols of their independent country and the dombyra has been high on their list. The dombyra is, in fact, so important to Kazakh national identity that there is a popular saying: “Naǵyz qazaq qazaq emes, naǵyz qazaq – dombyra”, which, translated, means “A real Kazakh is not a Kazakh, a real Kazakh is a dombra",

      text: "The nomadic cultures of Central Asia are not just the birthplace of many cultures in general, but in particular of violin-like string instruments as we know them today. Among the instruments used by the nomads was the qyl kobyz, the prototype of the modern kobyz. It was carved from a single piece of wood and had two strings made of horsehair, an animal sacred to the people of the steppe. The instrument was used by shamans who would play them inside yurts, casting spells and performing rituals. It was believed that the music could cure illnesses and break curses",

      text: "Kobyz is a bow instrument with two strings. It was hollowed out of one whole wooden piece – juniper (arsha), maple, pine-tree and birch. The instrument consisted of three parts: head (bas), middle (base is keude) and lower part (ayak). The base is made in the form of an open bowl stretched downside. This lower part of the instrument is covered with leather (sounding board). The support (tiek) is established on it. Kobyz possesses unusually rich and colourful timbre. This professional music art amply reflecting the life of a Kazakh nomad still adheres to its ancient sacral roots that once conceived it. The ancient notions and piety towards the instruments and music was constantly preserved in the traditional Kazakh society providing for the highest spiritual level of music art and a special deferential attitude towards the musical instruments.",
